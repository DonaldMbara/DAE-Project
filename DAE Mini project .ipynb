    "\n",
    "Crime prevention and ultimate elimination is one of the top priority goals of the National Development\n",
    "Plan (NDP). Crime affects all people irrespective of their background, and it is a topic that attracts a lot\n",
    "of media attention. Analysis will show that some groupings are affected by certain types of crime more\n",
    "than others. Crime statistics are essential in order to understand the temporal and spatial dynamics of\n",
    "crime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregate crime levels increased in 2017/18 compared to 2016/17. It is estimated that over 1,5 million\n",
    "incidences of household crime occurred in South Africa in 2017/18, which constitutes an increase of 5%\n",
    "compared to the previous year. Incidences of crime on individuals are estimated to be over 1,6 million,\n",
    "which is an increase of 5% from the previous year. Aggregate household crime levels increased in Free\n",
    "State, KwaZulu-Natal, North West, Gauteng and Mpumalanga. Individual crime levels increased in Free\n",
    "State, North West and Gauteng. North West experienced a drastic increase of 80% in the individual\n",
    "crime level. More provinces experienced an increase in household and individual crime levels if\n",
    "comparisons were done using proportions instead of absolute numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Housebreaking or burglary continued to be the dominant type of crime in 2017/18, accounting for 54%\n",
    "of all household crimes surveyed in the Victims of Crime Survey (VOCS). An estimated 832 122\n",
    "incidences of housebreaking occurred, which is a 7% increase compared to the previous year. An\n",
    "estimated 156 089 incidences of home robbery occurred, constituting an increase of 3% from last year.\n",
    "It is estimated that 16 809 incidences of murder occurred in 2017/18, which is an increase of about 4%\n",
    "from the previous year. The definition of murder in VOCS includes culpable homicide because it is\n",
    "practically impossible to separate the two types of killing in a household survey. This is one of the\n",
    "reasons that the VOCS estimates differ from the figures released by the South African Police Service\n",
    "(SAPS). Another reason for the VOCS murder estimates being different from those of the SAPS is that\n",
    "some murders recorded by the SAPS are not known at household level; for example, murders of\n",
    "immigrants that have no relatives in South Africa.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of individual crimes, theft of personal property was the most dominant, accounting for about\n",
    "41% of individual crimes. It is estimated that 693 219 incidences of theft of personal property occurred\n",
    "in 2017/18, which is a decrease of 2% from the previous year. Robbery away from home decreased by\n",
    "5%, sexual offence decreased by 61%, and assault increased by 12% from the previous year. Sexual\n",
    "offence has a narrower definition in VOCS compared to the SAPS definition, which includes offences\n",
    "such as bestiality and sexual acts with a corpse. On the other hand, assault is defined more broadly in\n",
    "the VOCS compared to the SAPS and combines SAPS common assault and assault with intent to cause\n",
    "grievous bodily harm. Disagreement between VOCS and SAPS statistics should not be a matter of\n",
    "concern at this stage, as the two organisations do not use the same definitions of crime types. Moreover,\n",
    "not all crime experienced by individuals is reported to the police. Despite the chall\n",
    "enge of non-aligned definitions, in many cases, VOCS and SAPS trends agree for similar types of crime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perceptions of South Africans on crime in 2017/18 were more sceptical compared to the previous year.\n",
    "About 42% thought property crime increased during the past three years. This is an increase of 6,9%\n",
    "from the previous year. Those who thought violent crime increased during the past three years were\n",
    "46%, which is an increase of 4,5% over the previous year. Western Cape was the most sceptical about\n",
    "crime trends, as 84% of Western Cape residents thought that crime in South African increased or stayed\n",
    "the same. Mpumalanga was the least sceptical among the nine provinces, where 65% thought that crime\n",
    "increased or stayed the same during the past three years. Crimes that are feared most are those that\n",
    "are most common. http://www.statssa.gov.za/?p=11627\n",

    "We are going to determine the relationship between the number of crime convictions (Conviction of theft of personal property, Conviction of fraud,Conviction of assault etc.) and household living condtions (Type of toilet facility,Access to/use electricity,Victim of other crimes etc.). Does having no access to electricity lead to a person commiting more crimes? Is Conviction of assault result from being a victim of assault? Below are the subsdiary questions that we are going to address.\n",

    "\n",
    "Since we are investigating the cause and effect relationship of crime in the household dataset which consists of questions and answers that will help us with our research,the dataset used was obtained from a secondary source in which a one-to-one interview survey was conducted in person. The survey consisted 306 multiple-choice questions. The aim was to conduct the survey with as many as possible household across South Africa's pronvinces. Different surveryers of approximately 500 were distributed across the main hotspots in which surverys were to be conducted across the country on the 10th April 2017. A household occupant was defined as member of a household that is being interviewd on the day of the questioning. Participants were given 30 minutes to fill in the survery and 23380 people participated.<br/>\n",

    "#### Methods of of analysis\n",

    "Since analysis will be based on quantitavive data, we prepared the data using a software called SPSS to analyse our data. Before the analysis, the dataset was checked for missing data and outliers. For this the (techniques) were used. All values outside the calculted range were considered outliers . The data was further analyzed using statistical graphs. A (statistical test was used) to test our hypothesis.<br/>\n",
