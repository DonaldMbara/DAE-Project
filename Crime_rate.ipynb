    "3) Limitations to the dataset are that the is no time frame in months on when the crime happend and what are the reasons the crime happend."

    "We have collected three different datasets from various sources to use for our research project which are South Africa crime statictics, Gini index of different countries and GDP per province.\n",
    "\n",
    "The South African Police Service (SAPS) is a national police force of the Republic of South Africa and it has collected the history of crime statistics from 2004 to 2015, broken down per province, statition and crime type. The dataset was collected from Stats SA.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gini index is a measure of distribution of income across a population of a country. If gini index < 0.2 represents perfect income equality, 0.2 - 0.3 relative equality, 0.3-0.4 adequate equality,0.4-0.5 big income gap and above 0.5 represents severe income gap. The dataset shows the gini index of different countries but we are more interested in South Africa, the dataset was collected from Kaggle.\n",

    "GDP (Gross Domestic Product) Per province measures the performance of a South African province's economy, the dataset was collected from Stats SA which diplays GDP from the year 2005 to 2017.\n",
