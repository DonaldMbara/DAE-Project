    "\n",
    "This project uses the data from the South African Police Services (SAPS), StatisticsSA and the Gini index (A measure of the distribution of income across a population.) to measure the extent to which poverty and inequality affects crime in 9 provices of SA.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Determine if correlation between crime variables category_of_crime , gini index and the GDP(of the given province) exists. Does the a low GDP lead to high crime rates? what crimes the leading crimes in low GDP provinces?\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Determine if the is a statistically significant difference between high GDP and low GDP provinces in terms of crime rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Limitations to the dataset are that the is no time frame in months on when the crime happend and what are the reasons the crime happend."

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "South Africas' Poverty and inequality has had a long history. In *per capita* terms it is an upper-middle-income country but most households still experience poverty or are at least vulnerable to being poor. Given that the country has developed policies to alleviate poverty, it still remains one of the highest in the world in terms of income inequality. South Africas' crime rates have also been on the rise since 1997, with the highest rate in Johannesburg followed by Pretoria, Cape Town and Durban. In this assignment we are going to look at the effects of inequality and poverty on the crime rate of South Africa\n",

    "## Data Description \n",
    "\n",
    "We have collected three different datasets from various sources to use for our research project which are South Africa crime statictics, Gini index of different countries and GDP per province.\n",
    "\n",
    "The South African Police Service (SAPS) is a national police force of the Republic of South Africa and it has collected the history of crime statistics from 2004 to 2015, broken down per province, statition and crime type. The dataset was collected from SAPS website.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gini Index is a measure of statistical dispersion intended to represent the income or wealth distribution of a nation's residents, and is the most commonly used measurement of inequality. If gini index < 0.2 represents perfect income equality, 0.2 - 0.3 relative equality, 0.3-0.4 adequate equality,0.4-0.5 big income gap and above 0.5 represents severe income gap. The dataset shows the gini index of different countries but we are more interested in South Africa, the dataset was collected from Kaggle.The data is for years 2006 to 2016\n",
    "\n",
    "GDP (Gross Domestic Product) Per province measures the performance of a South African province's economy, the dataset was collected from Stats SA which diplays GDP from the year 2005 to 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each dataset is read in seperately and then concatenated to provide time series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various variables of interest in this study. In this section the variables of interest will be briefly described:\n",
